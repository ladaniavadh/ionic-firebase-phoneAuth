Phone Authntication using firebase is Simple app to show that how phone authentication works. 

we can verifyPhoneNumber using otp in firebase. OTP will send by firebase and it auto detect the sms and verify the phone number. Some time auto detect will not work then enter it manually and verify it. 
If din't received the otp then request again to for the same.

don't forget to add your google-service.json file (for android) and GoogleService-info.plist(for ios), without this file will application will not build succesfully.
